**What is it**
SS14 displacement studio is a simple application for drawing displacement maps for the game space station 14. previously the only option was a asesprite plugin. it has drawing tools to change displacement direction. erase tool to make pixels transparent select tools. ect
**How to use**
Load background {a background like a humanoid to fit onto]
Load refrence {image to edit like clothes]
Create new displacement map or load one
Save

Use the paint tools to change a pixel to another pixel in a direction
You can click on the preview too to edit if you prefer

Erase just makes a pixel transparent

Selections allow you to only be able to effect a part of the canvas

Pixel Strength can let you move by multiple pixels in one click rather then multiple

**Final note**

Enjoy the application if there are issues just let me know and ill sort them at somepoint
